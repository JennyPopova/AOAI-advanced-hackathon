Guest-1: Invite me. I just wanna know. Shame, shame, shame on me.
Guest-2: I'm not hidden right.
Guest-1: You aren't. And and I will say, when I started this podcast and when I wrote my book and I started doing this very uncomfortable thing for me, which is trying to talk more about technology in the public, you were literally my role model. I said, you know, Neil deGrasse Tyson does such a wonderful job.

Guest-2: Things. No, you don't. That's right.
Guest-1: And I I I took you as a role model. And I Granted, I'm nowhere near as charming and as effective a communicator as you are, but I'm trying to do my best.
