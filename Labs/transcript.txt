Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of America's best-known astrophysicists and a beloved educator and advocate for the sciences. He has a great talent for presenting complex concepts in a clear and accessible manner. He's the head of the Hayden Planetarium and has been the director there since 1996. He's hosted numerous space-related TV and radio programs, published several books, and hosts the podcast StarTalk Radio. I am thrilled to have you on the podcast today, Neil. Well, thanks for having me. Why did it take you this long to invite me? I don't know. Shame, shame, shame on me. I'm not hidden, right? No, you aren't. And I will say, when I started this podcast and when I wrote my book and I started doing this very uncomfortable thing for me, which is trying to talk more about technology in the public, you were literally my role model. I said, Neil deGrasse Tyson does such a wonderful job communicating about the importance and the value of science to the public. We don't have people doing that about software and technology-related things. No, you don't. That's right. Very good point. I took you as a role model. Granted, I'm nowhere near as charming and as effective a communicator as you are, but I'm trying to do my best.
