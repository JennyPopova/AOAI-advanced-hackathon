Thanks for having me. Thank you. Why do you take you this long to invite me? I just want to know. Shame, shame, shame on me. I'm not hidden right. You aren't. And and I will say, when I started this podcast and when I wrote my book and I started doing this very uncomfortable thing for me, which is trying to talk more about technology in the public, you were literally my role model. I said, you know, Neil deGrasse Tyson does such a wonderful job.Communicating about the importance and the value of science to the public, We don't have people doing that about software and technology related things. No, you don't. That's right.And I I I took you as a role model. And I Granted, I'm nowhere near as charming and as effective a communicator as you are, but I'm trying to do my best.
